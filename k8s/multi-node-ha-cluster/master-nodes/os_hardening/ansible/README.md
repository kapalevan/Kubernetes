# OS Hardening Documentation for Kubernetes Cluster's Master Nodes

This documentation provides an overview of the tasks in the Ansible playbook designed for hardening an Ubuntu 20.04 server for Kubernetes cluster's API Server Load Balancer.

## Task Descriptions

### Set System Timezone
- **Purpose**: Ensures the server operates on the correct local time, critical for logging, cron jobs, and other time-sensitive operations.
  
### Set System Hostname
- **Purpose**: Assigns a hostname to the server, vital for network communication and server identification within a network.

### Enable UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- **Purpose**: Activates and configures the UFW to control incoming and outgoing network traffic, offering an essential layer of protection.

### Configure SSH Daemon and Client
- **Purpose**: Establishes secure configurations for the SSH server and client, crucial to safeguard against unauthorized access.

### Set Up Repository Configurations
- **Purpose**: Configures package manager repositories to ensure the system installs and updates packages from trusted sources.

### Install Required Packages
- **Purpose**: Installs essential tools for system monitoring, file editing, and various administrative tasks.

### Install Fail2ban
- **Purpose**: Protects against brute-force attacks by banning IPs showing malicious activity, enhancing SSH and service security.

### Create User Accounts
- **Purpose**: Manages user accounts with appropriate permissions, maintaining the principle of least privilege for system access.

### Install and Configure Auditd
- **Purpose**: Installs `auditd` to monitor and record system events, crucial for security auditing, compliance, and forensic analysis.

### Enable Automatic Security Updates
- **Purpose**: Automates security patch installation, maintaining system security integrity over time.

### Install and Configure NTP
- **Purpose**: Ensures accurate timekeeping, essential for logging, security, and system synchronization.

### Secure /tmp Filesystem
- **Purpose**: Mounts `/tmp` with enhanced security options, increasing filesystem security and stability.

### Configure System-wide Limits
- **Purpose**: Sets limits for system resources, preventing resource exhaustion and improving system performance and stability.

### Configure Logrotate for System Logs
- **Purpose**: Manages log file rotation and archival, ensuring efficient log storage and preventing disk space issues.

## Handlers

### Restart sshd
- **Purpose**: Reloads the SSH daemon after configuration changes, applying the new security settings without requiring a system reboot.

## Summary
This playbook enhances the security posture of the Ubuntu server by implementing key security measures. It sets up critical services, applies security best practices, and ensures the server is prepared for its role in the Kubernetes cluster.
