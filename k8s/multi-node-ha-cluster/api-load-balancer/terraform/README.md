### Terraform Configuration for Provisioning VM in VMware vSphere

#### Overview
This Terraform configuration is designed to provision a Virtual Machine (VM) in a VMware vSphere environment. It is specifically tailored to create an HAProxy instance for API load balancing, but can be adapted for other purposes.

#### File Structure
- `main.tf`: Contains the main configuration for the Terraform provider, data sources, and the VM resource. It defines how the VM is created and configured in vSphere.
- `variables.tf`: Declares variables used in `main.tf`. Variables allow for the customization of the Terraform configuration without altering the main code.
- `terraform.tfvars` (or custom `.tfvars` file): A file where you can specify the values for the declared variables. This file is not tracked in version control for security reasons.

#### Configuration Variables
The following variables are key to the configuration:
- `vm_name`: The name of the VM to be provisioned.
- `vcenter_server`: The address of the vCenter server.
- `template_name`: The name of the VM template to be used.
- `vm_ip`: The IP address to be assigned to the VM.
- `vm_hostname`: The hostname for the VM.
- `vm_folder`: The destination folder for the VM in vSphere.
- `vsphere_user` and `vsphere_password`: Credentials for accessing vSphere.

#### Setting Up Variable Values
1. Define sensitive variable values like vSphere credentials as environment variables:
   ```bash
   export TF_VAR_vsphere_user="your_username"
   export TF_VAR_vsphere_password="your_password"
   ```
2. For other variables, use a `terraform.tfvars` file. Example content:
   ```hcl
   vm_name       = "sample"
   vcenter_server = "example.com"
   template_name  = "template"
   vm_ip          = "100.100.100.100"
   vm_hostname    = "api-server.example.com"
   vm_folder      = "k8s"
   ```
   **Note:** Do not commit this file to version control.

#### Running Terraform Commands
1. **Initialization**: Run `terraform init` in the configuration directory. This will initialize the Terraform environment.
2. **Planning**: Execute `terraform plan` to review the changes that will be applied.
3. **Applying**: Use `terraform apply` to apply the configuration. Confirm the action when prompted.

#### Best Practices
- Always run `terraform plan` before `terraform apply` to understand the changes that will be made.
- Keep your `terraform.tfvars` file secure and out of version control.
- Regularly update your Terraform version to leverage the latest features and security improvements.

#### Important Note on Terraform State
- Terraform maintains the state of your infrastructure. If changes are made manually in the vSphere environment (outside of Terraform), it can lead to discrepancies between the real state and Terraform's state. This can result in Terraform being unable to manage the resources correctly. To avoid this issue, ensure that all changes to the managed infrastructure are made through Terraform.
