Great! With the updated structure, your repository should be more organized and manageable. Here's a brief overview of what each part of your repository structure now represents:

### Repository Overview:

1. **API Load Balancer (`api-load-balancer`)**
   - **Terraform**: Contains Terraform scripts for provisioning the infrastructure necessary for the API load balancer (likely HAProxy or a similar tool).
   - **Ansible**: Includes Ansible playbooks for configuring the API load balancer, setting up high availability, and integrating it with the Kubernetes master nodes.

2. **Apps Load Balancer (`apps-load-balancer`)**
   - **Terraform**: Holds Terraform scripts for setting up the load balancer for application traffic among worker nodes.
   - **Ansible**: Contains playbooks for configuring this load balancer, ensuring it properly distributes traffic to the worker nodes.

3. **Master Nodes (`master-nodes`)**
   - **Terraform**: Comprises scripts for provisioning the virtual machines or infrastructure for the Kubernetes master nodes.
   - **Ansible**: Includes playbooks for installing and configuring Kubernetes components on the master nodes, including etcd, the API server, controller manager, and scheduler.

4. **Worker Nodes (`worker-nodes`)**
   - **Terraform**: Contains scripts for creating the infrastructure required for worker nodes.
   - **Ansible**: Playbooks for setting up Kubernetes worker nodes, including the kubelet, kube-proxy, and any necessary container runtime.

5. **Common Configuration (`common`)**
   - **Terraform**: Stores shared Terraform configurations or modules that are used across different components.
   - **Ansible**: Holds common Ansible roles, tasks, or variables that are applicable to multiple components in the cluster.

6. **Scripts (`scripts`)**
   - A directory for any additional scripts (such as Bash scripts) needed for setup, utility, or maintenance tasks that are not directly handled by Terraform or Ansible.

### Best Practices:
- **Documentation**: Ensure each directory has a README file for guidance.
- **Version Control**: Regularly commit changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.
- **Modularity**: Keep the Terraform and Ansible configurations as modular as possible, allowing for reuse and easy maintenance.
- **Testing**: Before applying changes in production, test your configurations in a controlled environment.
- **Security**: Review scripts and configurations for security best practices, especially since this involves infrastructure provisioning and configuration management.

This structure sets a strong foundation for your Kubernetes cluster provisioning project, providing clarity and ease of navigation for anyone working with your repository.
